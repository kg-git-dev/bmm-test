title:  What do I do if my employer switches to a health plan that does not allow me to see a Beautiful Minds Medical’ doctor?

If you are currently enrolled in a plan that does not allow you to access Beautiful Minds Medical doctors, you can speak to your Benefits/Human Resources director and indicate that you want to continue seeing your current Beautiful Minds Medical’ doctor. Ask if there are any other options offered through the company that would accommodate your request. Call our office at <span class="call-num">(530) 889-8780</span>, where one of our friendly professionals can work with you and explain the various payment options available for you to continue seeing one of our Beautiful Minds Medical providers.
