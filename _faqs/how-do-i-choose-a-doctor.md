title:  How do I choose a doctor?
---

Assess your familyâ€™s medical needs for mental health care. Once you know the kind of care you need, do research to see if the doctor you are interested in can offer those services. Define the type of physician you want. Are you looking for a doctor that speaks a certain language, or has a specific type of training or experience? At Beautiful Minds Medical, you will find our providers interested in the integration of psychiatry and lifestyle medicine. If you are part of an HMO health plan, you may need a referral authorization from the plan prior to your visit. Contact your plan to ask if you need an authorization to see a Beautiful Minds Medical physician.
