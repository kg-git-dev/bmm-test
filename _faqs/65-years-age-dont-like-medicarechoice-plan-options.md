title:  I am over 65 years of age, and I donâ€™t like my Medicare+Choice plan. What are my options?

Unlike people who are covered by an employer-sponsored health plan, people who are eligible for Medicare can change health plans at any time or go back to straight Medicare. Before you make any decisions about your health plan changes, speak with your doctor to make sure your decision will not affect the care you need.
