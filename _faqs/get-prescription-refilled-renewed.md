title:  How do I get a prescription refilled or renewed?
---

If you are a new patient, bring your medications on your first visit to our office. Our doctor will approve refills of medications related to your mental health condition that you may need at that time. If you are not a new patient and you have a prescription that you need refilled, you do not need to call your doctor. Call your pharmacy but make sure you do when you are down to a 3-day supply of medicine. If you have used up all the authorized refills on your prescription, you will need to get a prescription renewal authorized by your doctor. Call your doctor, or your pharmacy will need to call your doctor to request authorization to renew the prescription. If you want a new prescription, you must see your doctor. For more information about your pharmacy benefits, call your health plan.
