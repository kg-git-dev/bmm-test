title:  What is the difference between a health insurance plan and Beautiful Minds Medical?
---

Health insurance plans provide members with health coverage. There are different types of health insurance plans, such as HMOs, PPOs, and EPOs. The health insurance plan contracts with medical groups, such as Beautiful Minds Medical, hospitals, and other medical providers to provide care to their members â€” you, our patients. Beautiful Minds Medical is not an insurance plan. We are your doctors; we provide you with your medical care. The health insurance process works like your auto insurance: You buy auto insurance from an insurance company, but you go to a mechanic to get your car fixed and your insurance may or may not cover the costs. The same process applies to your health insurance coverage.
