title:  Do I always need an authorization to see a Beautiful Minds Medical specialist or get other services?
---

Some health plans give patients the ability to self-refer for certain specialty services, such as obstetrics/gynecology or a mammogram, without an authorization from your doctor. If you have health insurance, check your health plan benefits to see what services you can receive without prior authorization. HMO patients need to get authorizations for most services. However, fee-for-service or cash-pay patients can see any Beautiful Minds Medicalâ€™ physician or receive any treatment you need without prior authorization.
