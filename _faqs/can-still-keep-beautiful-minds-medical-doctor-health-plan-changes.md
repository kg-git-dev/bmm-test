title:  Can I still keep my Beautiful Minds Medical doctor if my health plan changes?
---

Beautiful Minds Medical accepts a wide range of payment options, which means that if your health insurance coverage changes, very likely you can still keep your Beautiful Minds Medical doctor. If you are an HMO or PPO/EPO patient, call your new health plan and inform them that you want to keep your current Beautiful Minds Medical doctor or look for your Beautiful Minds Medical doctor in your new provider directory. Your health plan should allow you to change your doctor at any time. If you should lose your insurance coverage altogether or you learn that your Beautiful Minds Medical doctor is no longer available through your current health plan, call our office immediately to discuss how you can continue to receive care from your doctor at Beautiful Minds Medical.
