## Meet K'dee

Dr. Elsen has a deep burden for helping others. She was moved by this compassion to pursue both a master’s and doctorate degree in Clinical Psychology at Loma Linda University. She further completed an internship at VA Boston Healthcare System, affiliate of Harvard and Boston University, and a Post-Doctoral Fellowship at Loma Linda University Medical Center. Her experience includes depression, anxiety, trauma, grief, coping with chronic and terminal illness, and meaning-centered therapy. In addition to psychotherapy, she has experience in and enjoys teaching and supervising aspiring counseling students, and providing  seminars and trainings on mental health. Overall, Dr. Elsen’s mission is: “I want to equip others with the necessary skills and empower them to become their own therapist.”

Dr. Elsen further explains her mission and approach to psychotherapy by the following analogy: life is like a long and seemingly never-ending road trip. We get lost—we take the wrong turns, enter in the wrong GPS destination, accept misleading directions from others, and the long list of “mistakes” (or lessons) goes on. We know how to drive, but again, we get lost. Sometimes all we need is a co-pilot. Dr. Elsen is committed to being her clients’ co-pilot: guiding them to their intended destination (accomplish their goals), enjoy the journey (find fulfillment in life), and to confidently drive on their own (to become their own therapist!).
