## Meet Daniel

Dr. Binus believes in whole-person care. His goal is to understand and address the emotional,
physical, and spiritual factors that influence each patient’s well being.

Dr. Binus serves as clinical director of Beautiful Minds Medical. He provides outpatient psychiatry
and oversees the Intensive Outpatient Program. He’s also on the medical staff at Sutter Auburn Faith
Hospital, and a clinical instructor for Loma Linda University.

## Training

Dr. Binus completed his medical training and psychiatry residency at Loma Linda University, where he
became fascinated by the beauty of the mind. Dr. Binus spent many hours studying the emotional,
physical, spiritual, and biological factors that influence mental health. This study made him
passionate about treating the cause of mental illness, and not just masking the symptoms.

Dr. Binus completed a master’s degree in Public Health Education and enjoys conducting lectures and
workshops on depression and other mental health topics. He also developed a mental health curriculum
for the HIV/AIDS orphans of sub-Saharan Africa, which is currently being implemented in the country of
Lesotho.  Dr. Binus believes that proper mental-health education can greatly improve the lives of
people and communities.

## Beautiful Minds Medical

In March, 2011, Dr. Binus and his wife Melissa moved to Auburn and founded Beautiful Minds Medical.
Since that time, the practice has grown to include psychiatry, counseling, transcranial magnetic
stimulation (TMS) therapy and intensive outpatient care. Dr. Binus is grateful for the opportunity to
work with the Auburn community, one beautiful mind at a time.
