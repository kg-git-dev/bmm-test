## Meet Robert

Robert Nordman has been practicing as a physician assistant (PA) since 2002 after graduating from
Wayne State University in Detroit, MI. He also has a master’s in teaching from Andrew’s University,
where he was credentialed in English, religion, and science on the secondary level. He taught five
years at Battle Creek Academy. His undergraduate training included religion and health at Weimar
College.

Robert commenced his PA career working in physical medicine and rehab for six years. He then
transitioned to hospital medicine for two years before making a move to Arizona where he joined a
family practice. For two years, he served patients in both primary care and psychiatry before
transitioning entirely to psychiatry.

Robert served a population of high acuity in AZ and gained experience in treating schizophrenia,
bipolar, depression, OCD, Tourette’s, anxiety, and other mental disorders. 

Prior to becoming a PA, Robert gained experience in lifestyle medicine centers in three states. He
has a great interest in helping patients understand and incorporate non-pharmacological approaches to
improve their mental health. Leisure interests include gardening, classical music, beekeeping, hiking,
traveling, nutrition, investing in stocks, and reading.

In 2016 Robert joined the team at Beautiful Minds Medical as a psychiatric physician assistant.  He
sees a full patient load daily and occasionally lectures for the Intensive Outpatient Program.
