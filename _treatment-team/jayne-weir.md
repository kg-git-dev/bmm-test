> Just when the caterpillar thought the world was over, it became a butterfly. – Anonymous

If a caterpillar is going to function in the world as a butterfly, it must undergo metamorphosis.
Without change, survival would be impossible – this is true not only for the caterpillar, but for
people as well. Jayne acknowledges that making life transitions and changes may seem overwhelming,
scary, and difficult, yet they can also be exciting. Using a blend of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and
Dialectical Behavior Therapy strategies, Jayne desires to assist clients in making life changes to
improve their overall functioning. Inner changes in one’s thoughts and feelings, can lead to
significant transformations in outward behavior and daily life.

## Jayne’s Story

In her journey to become a therapist, Jayne completed a master’s degree in Social Work at Loma Linda
University. She then went to work for Child Protective Services, as she pursued Clinical Licensure.
Her areas of experience include: child welfare, adoptions, substance abuse, depression and anxiety
disorders.

Jayne spent over three decades in the Los Angeles area, before making a significant life change and
relocating to the rural outskirts of Auburn. After living her entire life in the city, she welcomes
the challenge of learning about how to live the “rural life” – brush clearance, burn piles, septic
systems, being “on propane” and using a wood burning stove. She also enjoys spending time outdoors,
gardening, and making things with her hands.
