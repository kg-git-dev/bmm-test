## Amanda's Story

Before she became a therapist, Amanda earned a bachelors degree in public relations from Pacific
Union College. While working in development/fundraising for a private high school, Amanda realized
that many of the students there were struggling with home and life challenges that made it hard for
them to focus in school. She wanted to find a way to help.

After reading a book on Christian counseling, Amanda decided to enter the field. She earned a masters
degree in marriage and family therapy at Loma Linda University. It brings Amanda great joy to help her
clients experience complete renovation!
