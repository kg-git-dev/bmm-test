**A Remedy for Loneliness**

By Timothy R. Jennings

Have you ever struggled with loneliness? Have you ever been in a room full of people but felt isolated, disconnected, alone? Have you been tormented by an uneasiness within, a feeling that something isn’t right, a restless longing to fill some emptiness deep inside? And have you tried to fill this void, to find relief in television, video games, shopping, alcohol, drugs, sex, or allowing others to take advantage of you, just so they will like you—so you won’t be alone—yet the emptiness, loneliness, and uneasiness never go away?

If this describes your experience, don’t be discouraged. Don’t accept the feelings as facts. Don’t believe the lies that pound away inside your head. There is freedom, there is a healing solution. The truth will heal. The truth will set you free. And what is the truth?

YOU are loved! You are loved for who you are, because you are a child of God!

- It doesn’t matter whether you were abused, abandoned, or mistreated by people—God loves you and will heal your broken heart, if you let Him!
- It doesn’t matter whether you have made bad choices—God loves you and will teach you how to make healthier choices, if you let Him!
- It doesn’t matter whether you have been a prostitute—publicly thrown down on the street—Jesus said to just such a woman, “I don’t condemn you. I love you and want you to be whole. Go and live—live in harmony with how I have designed life to operate.”

Our worth, our value, is not determined by what we have done or what we will do, but by who we are. We are children of God, created by him to love and to be loved.

If you have struggled in your life to experience this love, if you have tried to read the Bible but found it hard to understand, filled with terms that seem legal or even harsh, then I invite you to explore God’s love in *The Remedy New Testament an Expanded Paraphrase*, which you can read for free [here](http://comeandreason.com/index.php/en/the-remedy) —or you can get The Remedy app for FREE in your mobile device’s app store ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/remedy-bible/id1250668714?mt=8)) ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.remedybible.pro&hl=en)) or as a printed softcover book on Amazon ([click here](https://www.amazon.com/Remedy-Testament-Expanded-Paraphrase-Bible/dp/0985850272)).

In *The Remedy*, you will discover God’s remedy for your soul—His infinite, constant, never-ending love. God’s love is real; it is powerful and life-changing, and God’s love is poured out for you! Drink it in!
