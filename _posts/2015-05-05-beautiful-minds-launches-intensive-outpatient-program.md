Beautiful Minds Medical is excited to announce the launch of our new Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) in Auburn. This program is designed for clients who need more support than weekly therapy or doctor’s visits can offer, but are able to safely live at home.

The IOP began in March. We’re thankful to see it growing and are honored to offer this mental health service to members of Auburn and the surrounding communities.
</p>

The IOP provides care for those suffering from depression, anxiety and panic disorders, bipolar disorder, and substance abuse. Through group therapy sessions, medical management, health education classes, and more, our goal is to provide clients with the support and skills they need to move forward in lasting recovery.

The program is held 15 hours per week (9:00 A.M. to 12:00 P.M., Monday through Friday). Clients are encouraged to stay at least two weeks. Longer lengths of stay are assessed based on continuing need for therapy.

An estimated one in four American adults will suffer from mental illness this year. Many are ashamed or hesitant to seek treatment. At Beautiful Minds, we hope to help stop this stigma by offering compassion, acceptance, and hope.
