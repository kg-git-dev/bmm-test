Stigmas related to a person admitting to need psychiatric care typically account for why people are reluctant to seek mental health services. However, there is another, perhaps more powerful, inhibitor stopping people from seeking treatment for mental disorders: a fear of therapy.

The [media depicts a very stark picture of mental health treatment](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7299322_Media_Portrayal_of_Mental_Illness_and_Its_Treatments_What_Effect_Does_It_Have_on_People_with_Mental_Illness), especially inpatient programs. Scenes involving mental health assessment and treatment in television shows, movies, and books often portray psychiatric institutions as brutal, prison-like, authoritarian places in which clients are treated inhumanely and have little to no freedom.

Almost a half-century after its release, the description of mental health treatment painted in *One Flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest* remains implanted in the minds of many Americans. Despite the many reforms that have occurred since this era, mental institutions are considered as bereft places of suffering that do more harm than good to clients. Modern-day television shows like Shameless and Orange is the New Black illustrate similarly dim and dreadful inpatient experiences which taint the opinions of mental health treatment for those who are in need are are an inaccurate description of the most current practices.

If you or a loved one is facing a mental health disorder and is in need of treatment, it is vital to realize how misleading and damaging this kind of imagery can be. By learning how [mental health disorders](https://www.bridgestorecovery.com/treatment-specialties/) are treated in person-centered, evidence-based settings, you can overcome the myths associated with the treatment experience and get the care you need.

**Preparing Yourself to Consider Person-Centric Treatment**

Today, the mental health community and its practitioners are moving towards person-centered, individualized care. This treatment model is meant to overcome past practices that made people suffering from mental illness fear losing a sense of agency, or being treated as if they cannot narrate or navigate their own lives. Now, clients are encouraged to take their lives into their own hands. Practitioners honor, listen to, and empower clients.

This person-centric care is a collaboration between the individual person and healthcare providers to determine and reach treatment goals. The individual is involved in setting the goals and configuring a path to healthy living.

**Evidence-Based Therapy Combined with Person-Centric Treatment**

Make sure your treatment center offers [Evidence-Based Therapy](https://www.newharbinger.com/blog/what-are-evidence-based-treatment-methods-and-why-it-important-use-them) in addition to person-centric programming. Evidence-Based Therapy has increased the quality of mental health treatment, as clients now only undergo treatments that have been proven to be effective in the past. This practice ensures that clients are receiving care that is time and cost effective.

**Find Recovery by Overcoming Fear**

Mental health treatment has improved tremendously in the last half a century. Psychiatric caretakers and doctors are compassionate and provide individualized attention to clients’ diverse needs. This person-centered and evidence-based approach is empowering to clients.

Furthermore, in the 21st century, it is possible to learn what a treatment facility or inpatient program is like before visiting. To determine if a facility or program is right for you, you can explore their website, read about the staff and offerings, and get an idea of what it is like to be a part of their community.

Ask yourself the following questions when deciding which is right for you:

- Do they offer individualized care in addition to group care?
- Is the facility comfortable and home-like?
- How large is the program? Will the environment be intimate and allow for a lot of personal attention?
- What is the curriculum like?

Once you’ve found a facility you think would be a good fit for you, you can reach out to the staff to ask questions and take a tour of the physical location. There, you can use the knowledge you’ve learned about the programming and an in-person experience to make an educated decision about your treatment.

Taking these steps will allow you to start the journey towards a positive treatment experience and a future full of joy and peace.
