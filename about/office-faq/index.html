						<h2>2 - What should I do if I have an urgent medical need?</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="faqs-description">
						<p>If you have a life-threatening emergency, immediately call 911 or go to the nearest hospital. Notify
							your health plan and call your doctor’s office as soon as possible. If your urgent medical need occurs

						<h2>3 - How do I choose a doctor?</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="faqs-description">
						<p>Assess your family’s medical needs for mental health care. Once you know the kind of care you need, do
							research to see if the doctor you are interested in can offer those services. Define the type of
							physician you want. Are you looking for a doctor that speaks a certain language, or has a specific type
							of training or experience? At Beautiful Minds Medical, you will find our providers interested in the
							integration of psychiatry and lifestyle medicine. If you are part of an HMO health plan, you may need a
							referral authorization from the plan prior to your visit. Contact your plan to ask if you need an
							authorization to see a Beautiful Minds Medical physician.</p>

						<h2>5 - Can I still keep my Beautiful Minds Medical doctor if my health plan changes?</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="faqs-description">
						<p>Beautiful Minds Medical accepts a wide range of payment options, which means that if your health
							insurance coverage changes, very likely you can still keep your Beautiful Minds Medical doctor. If you
							are an HMO or PPO/EPO patient, call your new health plan and inform them that you want to keep your
							current Beautiful Minds Medical doctor or look for your Beautiful Minds Medical doctor in your new
							provider directory. Your health plan should allow you to change your doctor at any time. If you should
							lose your insurance coverage altogether or you learn that your Beautiful Minds Medical doctor is no
							longer available through your current health plan, call our office immediately to discuss how you can
							continue to receive care from your doctor at Beautiful Minds Medical.</p>

						<h2>6 - What do I do if my employer switches to a health plan that does not allow me to see a Beautiful
							Minds Medical’ doctor?</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="faqs-description">
						<p>If you are currently enrolled in a plan that does not allow you to access Beautiful Minds Medical
							doctors, you can speak to your Benefits/Human Resources director and indicate that you want to continue
							seeing your current Beautiful Minds Medical’ doctor. Ask if there are any other options offered through
							the company that would accommodate your request. Call our office at <span class="call-num">(530)
								889-8780</span>, where one of our friendly professionals can work with you and explain the various
							payment options available for you to continue seeing one of our Beautiful Minds Medical providers.</p>

						<h2>7 - I am over 65 years of age, and I don’t like my Medicare+Choice plan. What are my options?</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="faqs-description">
						<p>Unlike people who are covered by an employer-sponsored health plan, people who are eligible for
							Medicare can change health plans at any time or go back to straight Medicare. Before you make any
							decisions about your health plan changes, speak with your doctor to make sure your decision will not
							affect the care you need.</p>

						<h2>8 - Can you waive my co-pay or other fees if I don’t have the money?</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="faqs-description">
						<p>As your doctor. We are obligated by law to apply your benefits according to your health plan’s
							guidelines and cannot waive co-pays. We can, however, make payment arrangements with you. Call our
							Office at <span class="call-num">(530) 889-8780</span> to discuss your options with one of our friendly
							staff members.</p>

						<h2>9 - What is the difference between a health insurance plan and Beautiful Minds Medical?</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="faqs-description">
						<p>Health insurance plans provide members with health coverage. There are different types of health
							insurance plans, such as HMOs, PPOs, and EPOs. The health insurance plan contracts with medical groups,
							such as Beautiful Minds Medical, hospitals, and other medical providers to provide care to their members
							— you, our patients. Beautiful Minds Medical is not an insurance plan. We are your doctors; we provide
							you with your medical care. The health insurance process works like your auto insurance: You buy auto
							insurance from an insurance company, but you go to a mechanic to get your car fixed and your insurance
							may or may not cover the costs. The same process applies to your health insurance coverage.</p>

						<h2>10 - How do I get a prescription refilled or renewed?</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="faqs-description">
						<p>If you are a new patient, bring your medications on your first visit to our office. Our doctor will
							approve refills of medications related to your mental health condition that you may need at that time.
							If you are not a new patient and you have a prescription that you need refilled, you do not need to call
							your doctor. Call your pharmacy but make sure you do when you are down to a 3-day supply of medicine. If
							you have used up all the authorized refills on your prescription, you will need to get a prescription
							renewal authorized by your doctor. Call your doctor, or your pharmacy will need to call your doctor to
							request authorization to renew the prescription. If you want a new prescription, you must see your
							doctor. For more information about your pharmacy benefits, call your health plan.</p>

					<div class="faq-sub-heading">
						<h2>11 - Do I always need an authorization to see a Beautiful Minds Medical specialist or get other
							services?</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="faqs-description">
						<p>Some health plans give patients the ability to self-refer for certain specialty services, such as
							obstetrics/gynecology or a mammogram, without an authorization from your doctor. If you have health
							insurance, check your health plan benefits to see what services you can receive without prior
							authorization. HMO patients need to get authorizations for most services. However, fee-for-service or
							cash-pay patients can see any Beautiful Minds Medical’ physician or receive any treatment you need
							without prior authorization. To verify your eligibility and benefits, call our office at <span
								class="call-num">(530) 889-8780</span>.</p>

						<h2>12 - Who takes care of me in the hospital?</h2>

					<div class="faqs-description">
						<p>Of course! At Beautiful Minds Medical, we strive to create the best experience for you as a patient. If
							you are satisfied with your experience, we believe the greatest form of flattery is telling a friend or
							family member about your experience. If your friend or family member is interested in a Beautiful Minds
							Medical physician, they can call our office and we will help them find the right doctor or mental health
							professional for their specific need.</p>
