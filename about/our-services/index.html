										<p>Your story is unique and your treatment plan should be too. The following descriptions will
											help you understand our different services. Some patients choose one option, while others
											benefit from all three. Not sure what you need? Our intake team is happy to talk with you about
											your individual needs.</p>
										<h2 id="psychiatry">Psychiatry</h2>
										<p>Our psychiatry providers treat patients suffering from a wide variety of mental health
											concerns. They assess and diagnosis mental illness, prescribe and manage psychiatric
											medications, and work with each patient to meet their treatment goals.</p>
										<p>What can you expect? An initial psychiatry appointment lasts 50 minutes. During this time, your
											provider will complete a thorough psychiatric assessment and history to better understand your
											needs. He or she will develop a whole-person treatment plan that may include medication
											management, as well as instruction on nutrition, exercise, sleep, and other lifestyle habits.
										</p>
										<p>The psychiatrist does spend some time listening to patient's stories and helping them identify
											positive coping skills, but this is not the main feature of the appointment. If you're looking
											for someone to process life with through long discussions, you will probably want to seek
											counseling from one of our therapists. Of course, many patients benefit from receiving
											psychiatry and counseling at the same time.</p>
										<h2 id="counseling">Counseling</h2>
										<p>Counseling provides an environment for you to come and process life. Whether you're struggling
											with sadness, stress, a relationship issue, family problems, or just trying to learn how to do
											life better, our therapists can help.</p>
										<p>Counseling consists of weekly sessions focused on your healing and growth. As you begin
											treatment, your therapist will listen to your story and help you identify your treatment goals.
											The therapist's goal is to provide you with the empathy, support, and feedback you need to move
											forward in your healing journey.</p>
										<h2>Intensive Outpatient Program</h2>
										<p>If you need extra support, our Intensive Outpatient Program may  be just for you. The IOP meets
											for 15 hours each week (9:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. Monday-Friday). This program includes group and
											individual therapy, a wide variety of classes, and weekly psychiatry appointments. For more
											information about the IOP, click <a

										<h2 id="tms">Advanced TMS Therapy</h2>
										<p>NeuroStar Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive, non-drug approach indicated 
											for treating Major Depressive Disorder in patients who have failed to improve from prior 
											antidepressant medication in the current episode. <br><br>
