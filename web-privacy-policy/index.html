										<p>We respect the right to privacy of all visitors to our website.  We do not collect information
											that would personally identify you unless you choose to provide it. The personal information
											that you submit is shared only with those people in our organization who need this information
											to respond to your question or request. Information submitted through our online forms may be
											collected to ensure technical functionality. It will also be utilized to address any
											inappropriate use of our website. We do not save personal information to use for other purposes,
											nor do we provide it to any other organization.</p>
										<p>We have taken reasonable steps to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of personally
											identifiable information that you may provide.  You should understand, however, that electronic
											transmissions via the Internet are not necessarily secure from interception, and so we cannot
											absolutely guarantee the security or confidentiality of such transmissions.</p>
										<p>Except for authorized law enforcement investigations or other valid legal processes, we will
											not share any personally identifiable information we receive from you with any parties outside
											of our organization.</p>
										<h2>SURVEYS</h2>
										<p>We occasionally survey visitors to our site.  The information from these surveys is used in
											aggregate form to help us understand the needs of our visitors so that we can improve our site.
											We generally do not ask for information in surveys that would personally identify you; if we do
											request contact information for follow-up, you may decline to provide it.  If survey respondents
											provide personal information (such as an email address) in a survey, it is shared only with
											those people who need to see it to respond to the question or request.</p>
										<h2>IP ADDRESSES</h2>
										<p>The Web server automatically collects the IP (which stands for Internet Protocol) address of
											the computers that access our site. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer
											when you access the Internet. It is not truly personally identifiable information because many
											different individuals can access the Internet via the same computer. We use this information in
											aggregate form to understand how our site is being used and how we can better serve visitors.
										</p>
										<h2>COOKIES</h2>
										<p>We collect information about visitors to our site using “cookies.” (See <a
												href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/cookie.html" target="_blank">definition</a> on
											Webopedia.) We use <strong>persistent</strong> cookies to recognize a repeat visitor and offer
											the visitor a set of services or information requested in a previous visit. We
											use <strong>session </strong>cookies to track a visitor’s path through our site during a visit,
											to help us understand how people use our site.</p>
